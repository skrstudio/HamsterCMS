admin panel (**login password**)

**The new script works under PHP 8. 
NEW THEMES AVAILABLE!
There is a button to log out of the session.
The buttons have become more beautiful and more convenient to use
multi-templates and working with templates from the admin panel.
You can assign your own template to each page. 
Adapting templates from the previous version is very simple**

What is all this for?

The script is intended for people who are not knowledgeable in programming 
and who want to quickly create a home page on the Internet

this script is an example of how websites should be made, as I see it, 
how it should be. all these thick frameworks, a bunch of 
additional languages, various hundred-megabyte hipster crafts 
just to deploy an editable home page? - this is not about this script.

This script is also useful for training, the simple code allows for this.
The script is suitable for adherents of old technologies, for ascetic users, 
downgraders, lovers of retro computers and computer equipment,
who want to create a quick, simple, and beautiful home page, or multi-page.

tests showed that the site on this template launched on a 386 computer 
with 16 MHz and 8 RAM under Windows 95 (it will also launch under 3.11 
if Internet Explorer 5 is installed), and specifically on this engine 
it is easily opened by browsers under DOS, and the content is edited 
through the admin panel. On the hamster website there are many templates 
for downloading that will work correctly in the **Links browser under DOS**

in general, for minimalists this is what you need

    Now a little description of this particular template.
as you can see, it is a little similar to the Windows 95 interface, 
made in HTML4 without frameworks and add-ons that could work 
with very old browsers from the 90s 
(will work in IE5 since it has support for UTF8).

For the script to work, you only need free hosting with support for PHP 8.*
copy the files as is to the hosting, open, check - it works.

go to the admin panel **admin.php**, enter your 
login and password (login password), select open the file at the top, edit, save.
Don’t forget to also change your login and password by 
editing the admin.php file, the name of which can also be changed, 
this will not affect performance.

The admin panel (**login password** by default) can be renamed, this does not affect the functionality.
an admin panel is not necessarily needed on hosting; you can use any text editor, or if you don’t plan to edit pages anymore, remove this file from the folder.

The templates inside the archive (there are several of them) make it clear how exactly you can layout for HamsterCMS. the simplest example is the **Plain** template in which we can see two important lines, namely [[NAVIGATION]] which is responsible for the navigation, and [[CONTENTS]] which is responsible for the content of your page. you can also create a footer.txt and write [[FOOTER]] in the template below, which will pull the contents of your footer from your text file, so another block will appear on the site. You can create a great variety of blocks. if you have a two-column template, you can create several submenus with news or widgets. this way you can easily make up any template downloaded from the Internet, or adapt one drawn by hand.

                                                                         
                                                                         ***    P.S.   ***
                                                                
**I want to express special gratitude to Wolf Vogel who helped with the latest update 
and introduced a lot of cool things that helped make the functionality more convenient**

Enjoy your use.

thank you for your attention
